As Muslims, we have quite a lot of differences among ourselves especially Sunni and Shi'a. The enemies know that and they always work to extend the division, fund it, help it grow wider and arm us to fight and kill each other. Our divide is so strong that we often think we are irreconcilable. I often ask why. I have been labelled and called several unprintable names because of that. I know there would be a lot of that under this post too. So, it's alright. 
Nevertheless, I am very tired of all of that. It has always been to our disadvantage and has always brought disaster upon the Ummah. We relate with our non-Muslim neighbours and friends with so much respect and mutual love. Why can't we do the same with fellow Muslims? Why does a Shi'a have to be an enemy to a Sunni?
It is high time we move past those artificial divisions and begin to chart a path that brings us all together. Our only enemies are those who rose from within our communities with whatever the names they chose but are hellbent on killing us and people of other faiths unjustly. Whatever the differences I have with a fellow Muslim, I still want to meet him or her with a cheerful face. Would I have committed a sin by meeting a Shi'a cheerfully? Don't lecture me about the problems with Shi'a ideologies, I know them quite well. I prefer to see and emphasize the areas we agree upon and de-emphasize our differences. I am not saying everything everywhere is acceptable but we can always organise events where we discuss our common challenges, our differences and find ways to solve our collective problems. 
Will I become a sinner if I think this way? Have I become a sinner if as a Sunni Muslim relates with a Shi'a with respect and recognizes his Islam? I don't think so. 
Among us, the Ahlus-Sunnah, there are extremists as they are among the Shi'a. Those are the ones who are quick to make Takfīr of the other Muslims and in extreme cases, become violent and take up arms. The enemies see them and make use of them all the time. The majority of Shi'a still have the same beliefs as the Sunni, same Qur'ān, same Rasūl SAW, same Qiblah, same love and concern for the Ummah. Our differences are not irreconcilable. The division started with politics, it's important we end it with faith. To whose gain is it when we unite? To whose loss is it when we remain disunited? The Ummah will never be able to face her enemy when she remains disjointed. The enemies fear that, hence, they continue to invest in our disunity with our help.
